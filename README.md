# UNDER PROGRESS

This package is meant to allow automatic generation of Vulcan schemas from trusted sources (Schema.org for the moment).

It is an experimental work under progress. Use with caution.

## Contribution

- Issues and feature requests are always welcome, but we don't guarantee any support for the moment
- We promote bug-driven development. If you identify a bug, write a tests for it (that should fail), and fix until your test is passing.
